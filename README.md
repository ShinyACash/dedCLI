# dedCLI
My very own watch_d0gs themed CLI app for my personal use but can be modified for friends to use! (Kinda useful for ppl who do ctfs or usually like automating things.)
<br />
More features on the way!

# How to use?
Well, since this is a very early build, try opening the terminal in the folder you downloaded this repo in and then use the command `node .` to run. 
<br />
Make sure you have node js installed in your computer, how to do this you ask? go watch a tutorial :)). This project may become an npx executable in the future but thats too far for now.
- Only works on w1nd0ws :))

# Current Features
- Opens Spotify ('cause why not?)<br />
- Has a method for producing a STEP decoy (opens np++ or intelliJ instantly if it exists on your pc 😋) <br />
- Starts up my very own To Do List site for making well, todo lists! <br/>
- CTF tools opener  for my fellow CTF players (opens deepseek, dogbolt and cyberchef) <br />
- Placeholder! (shows you a cool terminal art that can just be a cool screenspace to flex)<br />

# Upcoming Features (under dev)
- CTF Tools update (extra functionality) <br />
- Cool little Minigame <br />
- Package Manager and Updater once I convert this into a package <br />
- Easter Eggs <br />
- Custom Commands and many more!
